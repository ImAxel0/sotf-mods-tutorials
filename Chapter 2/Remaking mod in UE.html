              <h3>Brief explanation</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                In the previous lesson we have made our first mod just by using these two lines of code.
            </p>
    
            <pre><code class="language-cs">
LocalPlayer.FpCharacter.SetWalkSpeed(10);
LocalPlayer.FpCharacter.SetRunSpeed(20);
            </code></pre>
    
            <p>
                You are now probably wondering where these two lines comes from and how did I know i have to write those words.
                This is where <b>UnityExplorer</b> (but also dnSpy) will greatly help in seeing what we can do and how to do it.
                This time, instead of coding the mod, we will set the player walk and run speed in game using UnityExplorer.
                If you haven't installed it before, refer to <a href="../Chapter 0/Installing must have programs.html">Installing
                    must have programs.
                </a>
            </p>

                <h3>Using UnityExplorer to remake the mod</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                Now that you have <b>UnityExplorer</b> installed, it's time to launch the game and load into a savegame
                &#40;preferably a new one to not mess with your normal stuff&#41;
                <br>When you gain player control, press F7 to bring up UnityExplorer on screen.
    
                <img style="display: block;" src="images/Remaking mod in UE/UE-SceneView.png" width="300px">
    
                You will see a top bar menu and another window. At the top of the window switch to the <b>Object Search</b> tab, 
                <br>then in the <b>Class filter</b> we need to type <q><b>LocalPlayer</b></q> as we did in our coded mod to get a reference of it.
    
                <img style="display: block;" src="images/Remaking mod in UE/UE-ObjectView.png" width="300px">
    
                After that, click on one of the results and you will be presented with all the stuff which has to do with it.
                <br>If you remember, in our code we wrote <q>LocalPlayer.FpCharacter</q>. This was needed as the <q>SetWalkSpeed</q> and 
                <q>SetRunSpeed</q> methods are tied to the FirstPersonCharacter &#40;<b>FpCharacter</b> in code&#41;.
                <br>So we basically need to chain things together using dots to reach what we want.
                
                <img style="display: block;" src="images/Remaking mod in UE/UE-LocalPlayer.png" width="600px">
    
                Returning to our newly opened UnityExplorer window with LocalPlayer stuff, we can scroll down to search the
                <q>FpCharacter</q>, click <b>Inspect</b> and we will now see all <b>FpCharacter</b> tied stuff in a new window.
    
                <img style="display: block;" src="images/Remaking mod in UE/UE-FpCharacter.png" width="600px">
    
                If we scroll down to the <q>S</q> we can se our <q>SetWalkSpeed</q> and <q>SetRunSpeed</q> methods we used in our code before.
                <br>To change the corresponding value, click on <b>Evaluate</b> and enter the values accordingly.
                <br>To execute each method, click on the <b>Evaluate</b> button, then close UnityExplorer with F7.
    
                <img style="display: block;" src="images/Remaking mod in UE/UE-SettingMethods.png" width="600px">
    
                You can now see the player moves faster, and you can test it with different values to see that it works.
                <br>Note that these are run-time changes, and won't be saved after restarting the game, unlike a coded mod &#40;but be careful that adding
                items or spawning something in the world then saving will persist&#41;.

                <h3>What we learned</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                As you have seen, <b>UnityExplorer</b> is a really powerfull tool that can greetly help in mods making, allowing us to test things while
                in game and changing how the game behave.
