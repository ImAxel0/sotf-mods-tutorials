              <h3>What are methods&#63;</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                Methods are basically functions, <q>containers of code</q> which we can call &#40;execute&#41; whenever we need.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                To declare a method we need to follow a certain syntax which is the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The method <b>accessibility</b>: can either be public, private, protected or internal &#40;there may be others but we aren't interested for these mods&#41;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <b>return type</b> of the method, because every method can return a value of the defined variable type
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <b>method name</b>, which we use to call &#40;execute&#41; it
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        &#91;optional&#93; The method <b>parameter&#47;s</b>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
    
            <pre><code class="language-cs">
// declaring a method of public accessibility, with a return type of void and "MyMethod" as name
public void MyMethod()
{

}
            </code></pre>

            <div class="lesson-section">
                <h3>Methods accessibility types</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                As said before we have mainly four accessibility types which are public, private, protected and internal.
                <br>
                We will talk about accessibility in the <b>classes</b> lesson since we need to understand something more to get it.
            </p>

            <div class="lesson-section">
                <h3>Methods return type</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                Each method can, and you hear it right, <b>can</b>, not must, return a value of the defined type.
                <br>
                In the example below "MyMethod" return an <b>int</b> value which is equal to 5;
            </p>

            <pre><code class="language-cs">
// declaring a method of public accessibility, with a return type of int and "MyMethod" as name
public int MyMethod()
{
    return 5; // the int value the method returns
}
            </code></pre>

            <div class="lesson-section">
                <h3>Other examples</h3>
            </div>
            <pre><code class="language-cs">
// declaring a method of public accessibility, with a return type of bool and "MyMethod" as name            
public bool MyMethod()
{
    return true; // returning a boolean
}
            </code></pre>
    
            <pre><code class="language-cs">
// declaring a method of public accessibility, with a return type of string and "MyMethod" as name            
public string MyMethod()
{
    return "Hello"; // returning a string
}
            </code></pre>
    
            <p>
                As said before, a method <b>can</b> and not must return a value. This means we have a special type which is called
                <b>void</b>.
                <br>
                A method with a return type of <b>void</b> simply means that it returns nothing and it just executes the code inside the curly braces.
            </p>
    
            <pre><code class="language-cs">
// declaring a method of public accessibility, with a return type of void and "MyMethod" as name            
public void MyMethod()
{
    // do the stuff in here
}
            </code></pre>
    
            <p>
                On the other side, if we define a return type which is not <b>void</b>, we must use the <q>return</q> statement with the
                appropriate value type.
            </p>

            <div class="lesson-section">
                <h3>How to call a method&#63;</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                Calling a method is very simple.
                <br>
                To do it we need to write the method name, followed by &#40;&#41;, inside another method.
            </p>
    
            <pre><code class="language-cs">
public void SetPlayerHealth()
{
    LocalPlayer.Vitals.SetHealth(50);
}

protected override void OnGameStart()
{
    SetPlayerHealth(); // calling the method above
}
            </code></pre>
    
            <p>
                In the example above, when we load into a game and gain player control, our <b>OnGameStart</b> method will automatically
                be executed as we have seen in the first mod tutorial. 
                <br>
                This means that our <q>SetPlayerHealth&#40;&#41;;</q> line will also be executed and the method will be called, changing the player health to 50.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Summing up, we can say we use methods to jump onto different sections of code, so we can keep it organized and
                understandable.
            </p>

            <div class="lesson-section">
                <h3>Passing parameters to methods</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                <b>What does this mean&#63;</b> It means we can pass values &#40;or variables&#41; when calling our methods.
                <br>
                This makes them much more flexible as we can pass different values for each method.
            </p>
    
            <pre><code class="language-cs">
public void SetHealth(int value)
{
    LocalPlayer.Vitals.SetHealth(value);
}

public void SetStamina(int value)
{
    LocalPlayer.Vitals.SetStamina(value);
}

protected override void OnGameStart()
{
    SetHealth(50);
    SetStamina(10);
}
            </code></pre>
    
            <p>
                In the above example we made a first method called <q>SetHealth</q> which takes an <b>int</b> parameter
                and another method called <q>SetStamina</q> which takes another <b>int</b> parameter.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                When we boot into the game, our <q>SetHealth</q> method will be called first, passing the value 50 which will set the player health to it.
                <br>
                After that the <q>SetStamina</q> method will be called, passing the value 10 which will set the player stamina to it.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                We can also pass multiple parameters in the same method as seen in the example below:
            </p>
    
            <pre><code class="language-cs">
public void SetHealthAndStamina(int firstValue, int secondValue)
{
    LocalPlayer.Vitals.SetHealth(firstValue);
    LocalPlayer.Vitals.SetStamina(secondValue);
}

protected override void OnGameStart()
{
    SetHealthAndStamina(50, 10);
}
            </code></pre>
    
            <div class="lesson-section">
                <h3>Methods returning a value</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                We have said before that methods <b>can</b> return a value of the defined type.
                <br>
                So we will take a method returning an <b>int</b> as an example below.
            </p>
    
            <pre><code class="language-cs">
public int GetHealthValue()
{
    return LocalPlayer.Vitals.GetHealth();
}

protected override void OnGameStart()
{
    int returnedValue = SetHealth();
    LocalPlayer.Vitals.SetHealth(returnedValue);
}
            </code></pre>
    
            <p>
                When our <b>OnGameStart</b> method is executed, the <q>GetHealthValue</q> method is called and will return the
                current player health, which will be stored inside the <b>returnedValue</b> integer variable.
                <br>
                After that, the <b>returnedValue</b> int variable is used to set the player health to what the <q>GetHealthValue</q>
                method return before.
            </p>

            <div class="lesson-section">
                <h3>Summing up</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                As you have seen, methods are one fundamental of these mods, and you will need to use them 100&#37; of the time.
            </p>
