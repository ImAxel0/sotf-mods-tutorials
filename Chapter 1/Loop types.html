              <h3>What is a loop and when should we use it&#63;</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                A loop happens whenever our code in curly braces gets executed as many times as we specify or how much is needed.
                <br>Examples are doing something only while a condition is met &#40;<b>while loop&#41;</b>, or doing something
                for as many times we need &#40;<b>for loop&#41;</b>.
                <br>There are mainly 3 types of loops, and these are:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>while</b> loop</li>
                    <li><b>for</b> loop</li>
                    <li><b>foreach</b> loop</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
    
            <p>
                To make it more clear, we start with a <b>while</b> loop example:
            </p>

            <div class="lesson-section">
                <h3>While loop</h3>
            </div>
            <pre><code class="language-cs">
protected override void OnGameStart()
{
    while (true)
    {
        // code in here will be executed and repeated infinitely
    }
}        
            </code></pre>
                
            <p>
                As you can see, the code inside the curly braces will get executed forever as the above condition
                is always <b>true</b> &#40;which means we want to execute the code in the curly braces&#41;.
                <br>
                This loop type should almost never be use like this, as it will cause the game to freeze since we can't escape
                from it. 
                <br>
                Furthermore, it's also almost never used anyway since <b>for</b> and <b>foreach</b> loops do the job better.
            </p>

            <div class="lesson-section">
                <h3>For loop</h3>
            </div>
            <pre><code class="language-cs">
protected override void OnGameStart()
{
    // this loop set the player health to 50 for ten times
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        LocalPlayer.Vitals.SetHealth(50);
    }
    // after the loop is finished the code will continue from here
}        
            </code></pre>
    
            <p>
                <b>For</b> loops are used to do something as many times as we want or until a condition is reached.
                <br>
                In the above example, we are setting the player health to 50 ten times.           
            </p>
    
            <p>
                <b>How do I read the above example&#63;</b>
                <br>
                Let's break it up in different parts to understand it.
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Int i &#61; 0:</i> this is our counter starting point, this means we are starting from the number 0</li>
                    <li><i>i &#60; 10:</i> this is the condition we need to break to exit the loop, 
                    so in this example we can red it as &#34;set the player health to 50 until <b>i</b> is &#60; 10
                    </li>
                    <li><i>i++:</i> this is how much the <b>i</b> variable should increase each time the code in the curly braces finishes executing.
                    In this example <b>i++</b> means &#43;1 so the <b>i</b> variable will increase by one each time an iteration finishes.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So summing up the above, the code example can be translate as &#34;while <b>i</b> is less than 10, execute
                the code inside the curly braces&#34;.
                <br>
                This basically means we will set our player halth to 50 ten times, since <b>i</b> at the start
                of the loop has a value of 0 and is increased by one each time an iteration finishes. 
                <br>
                When <b>i</b> will be equal to 10 and so the condition is broken, we will exit the <b>for loop</b>.
            </p>

            <div class="lesson-section">
                <h3>Foreach loop</h3>
            </div>
            <pre><code class="language-cs">
                protected override void OnGameStart()
                {
                    List<int> numbers = new() { 7, 12, 3, 5, 22 };
                
                    foreach (int number in numbers)
                    {
                        number // i'm the currently pointed number
                    }
                }        
            </code></pre>
    
            <p>
                <b>Foreach</b> loops are type of loops which are very similar to <b>for</b> loops. In fact, they basically does the same job.
                <br>
                The main difference is that they are used with <b>Lists</b> or <b>Arrays</b> variable types to
                simplify their looping writing.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                In the above example, we are iterating through the <b>numbers</b> list, so every time we reach the end
                of ours curly braces, we will point to the next number in the list.
                <br>
                Translating in simple words: &#34;in the first loop iteration <b>number</b> will be equal to the first number of the <b>numbers</b>
                list &#40;7&#41;, at the second iteration <b>number</b> will be equal to the second number of the <b>numbers</b> list &#40;12&#41; etc.
                <br>
                When we reach the latest number in the <b>numbers</b> list &#40;22&#41; we will exit the loop.
            </p>
