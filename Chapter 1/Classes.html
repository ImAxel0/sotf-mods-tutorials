            <p>
                Now that we have seen different C&#35; stuff, it's time to introduce classes.
                <br>
                We can see a class as a container of all the previous stuff &#40;fields, methods etc.&#41;
            </p>
    
            <p>
                When we create a mod project, you will see that a class will be automatically created 
                and that three predefined-methods are placed into it.
            </p>

using SonsSdk;

namespace PlayerSpeedMod;

public class PlayerSpeedMod : SonsMod // start of the PlayerSpeedMod class
{
    public PlayerSpeedMod()
    {

        //HarmonyPatchAll = true;
    }

    protected override void OnInitializeMod()
    {
        Config.Init();
    }

    protected override void OnSdkInitialized()
    {
        PlayerSpeedModUi.Create();
    }

    protected override void OnGameStart()
    {
    }
} // end of the PlayerSpeedMod class

            <p>
                Taking a game example in dnSpy, the <b>FirstPersonCharacter</b> is also a class, which contains all the different methods
                &#40;e.g <b>SetWalkSpeed</b> and <b>SetRunSpeed</b>&#41;.

                Since the mods we are making at this point are pretty simple, we don't need to create other classes. 
                <br>
                But if we need to make something bigger, then they are pretty much a must to organize the code.
                <br>
                We can take my <a href="https://sotf-mods.com/mods/imaxel/axel's-mod-menu">Mod menu</a> as an example below.
    
                <img style="display: block;" src="Images/ModMenu-classes.png" width="200px">

            <p>
                As you can see I have used multiple .cs files, each corresponding to a different class with a specific purpose.
            </p>

            <div class="lesson-section">
                <h3>Accessibility of methods and fields between classes</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                As we talked in the <b>methods</b> and <b>fields</b> lessons before, we have different accessibility types we can assign to them.
                <br>
                Those are public, private, protected and internal for <b>methods</b> and public or private for <b>fields</b>.
            </p>

            <div class="lesson-section">
                <h3>Methods accessibility types</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>public</b>: a method with an accessibility type of public means that we can also access &#40;and so call&#41; that method from other classes
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>private</b>: a method with an accessibility type of private means that we can access &#40;and so call&#41; that method only from within the same class
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>protected</b>: a method with an accessibility type of protected means that we can access &#40;and so call&#41; that method only from within the same class or in class that is inherited from that class
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>internal</b>: a method with an accessibility type of internal means that we can access &#40;and so call&#41; that method only from within it's own assembly
                    </li>
                </ul>
                If the last two doesn't make any sense it's fine, since we almost never need to use them anyway to make a mod.
            </p>

            <pre><code class="language-cs">
public class PlayerSpeedMod : SonsMod
{
    protected override void OnGameStart()

        AnotherClass.PrivateMethod(); // NOT OK, PrivateMethod() is a private method and can't be accessed from the PlayerSpeedMod class

            <p>
                You will have probably noticed that our methods and fields in <b>AnotherClass</b> are declared as <b>static</b>.
                <br>
                This is needed when you want to access them directly from another class or inside a static method like we did.
                <br>
                In fact, almost all my mods uses the static keyword when declaring a field or a method.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                One thing that also needs to be mentioned is that a method declared without any accessibility type will default to <b>private</b> and so it won't be accessible
                from another class if not declared like <b>public</b>. 
                <br>
                Along with that, you may have noticed classes also have accessibility type, but we can almost always use the public one for these mods.
            </p>

            <p>
                Classes are here to keep our code organized and allows to separate sections of code with different purposes.
                <br>
                Since we are still making some pretty small mods, you probably won't need to create other classes for now.
