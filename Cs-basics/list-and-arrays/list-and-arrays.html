        <h1>C&#35; Lists &#38; Arrays</h1>

        <h2>What are Lists&#63;</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Lists</b> are basically containers of variables. They can containe multiple values, as long
            as they are of the same defined type.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-cs">
List<int> numbers = new() { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }; // declaring a list of type int named "numbers"            
        </code></pre>

        <pre><code class="language-cs">
// another way to organize the code for readability   
List<int> numbers = new() { 
    1, 2, 3, 4, 5 
};       
        </code></pre>

        <p>
            In the above example, we have basically declared five <b>int</b> variables, which are contained inside
            the <b>numbers</b> list.
            <br>
            Lists are very useful and the game also uses them a lot. 
            <br>
            They can keep the code more clean by not having to
            declare multiple variables, or group some which have the same usage.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Taking a Sons of the Forest list example, the <b>ItemData</b> list as we can see both in code
            and dnSpy &#40;but also UnityExplorer&#41; contains all the the informations about each game item
            &#40;e.g ID, name etc.&#41;.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-cs">
protected override void OnGameStart()
{
    ItemDatabaseManager._instance._itemDataList; // this list contains the data for each game item
}
        </code></pre>

        <img style="display: block;" src="images/ItemData-list.png" width="400px">

        <h2>What are Arrays&#63;</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Arrays</b> are similar to Lists, with the difference that we can't &#40;or atleast we shouldn't&#41;
            change their content after creating them. So they basically act as read&#45;only.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-cs">
protected override void OnGameStart()
{
    int[] array = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }; // declaring an array of type int with 5 values
}
        </code></pre>

        <p>
            I won't explain more of them as I nearly never need to use them for mods unlike Lists.
        </p>
