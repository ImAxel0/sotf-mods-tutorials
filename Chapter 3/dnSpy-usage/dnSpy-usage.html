        <h1>dnSpy general usage</h1>

        <h2>What is dnSpy used for&#63;</h2>
        <p>
            <b>dnSpy</b> is a tool which let us look into the game code while it's closed, to see how it does stuff and also expand our modding capabilities.
            <br>With patch 07 of the game &#40;release of Dedicated servers&#41;, the source code of the game was leaked, so we can now see 
            the game code up to that patch using tools like <b>dnSpy</b>.            
        </p>

        <p>
            If you haven't already downloaded dnSpy, download it from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy">here</a> and extract
            the zip content inside another folder.
            <br>To launch it, double click <b>dnSpy.exe</b>, you will see a window similar to the below.

        </p>

        <h2>Loading the <q>game code</q> in dnSpy</h2>
        <p>
            First, we need to get the leaked source code dll's (you can ask for them in the sotf discord or find them yourself).
            <br>Then, on the top left of dnSpy, click on <b>File</b>, then <b>Open...</b> and browse to where the leaked source code dll's are.

            <img style="display: block;" src="images/dnSpy-loading-assemblies.png" width="400px">

            Do CTRL&#43;A to select all of them and press <b>Open</b> at the bottom right corner to load them.

        </p>
        <p>          
            Done, we have loaded the game code inside dnSpy as you can see in the image below.

        <h2>Finding the first mod stuff</h2>
        <p>
            To make it clear how it works, lets find what we used to make the change player speed mod.
            <br>On the bottom you can see a searchbar and a <q><b>Search for:</b></q> filter. If not already, set it to <b>Class</b> and <b>All Files</b>.
            <br>Type <q><b>LocalPlayer</b></q> in the searchbox and you will see a list of results.
            <br>We are only interested in the first one, so double click on it to navigate to it.

            <img style="display: block;" src="images/LocalPlayer-search.png" width="800px">
        </p>

        <p>
            On the left panel, expand the LocalPlayer dropdown menu and you will see a list of things related to it,
            some self explanatory.

            <img style="display: block;" src="images/LocalPlayer-expand.png" width="400px">
        </p>

        <p>
            If you scroll down a bit, you can see our <b>FpCharacter</b> we used to make our first mod.

            <img style="display: block;" src="images/FpCharacter-entry.png" width="800px">
        </p>

        <p>
            Now click on it, and on the right panel click on <b>FirstPersonCharacter</b> to navigate to it.

            <img style="display: block;" src="images/FpCharacter-property.png" width="500px">
        </p>

        <p>
            Expand the FirstPersonCharacter dropdown menu on the left panel as we did with the LocalPlayer and you will see all the stuff related to the
            <b>FirstPersonCharacter</b>.
            <br>If you scroll down a bit, you will see ours <b>SetWalkSpeed</b> and <b>SetRunSpeed</b> methods we used before to make the mod.

        <h2>Summing up</h2>
        <p>
            <b>dnSpy</b> as UnityExplorer is a powerfull tool which let us investigate into the game code, with the difference that we can use it while
            the game is closed and so we can't do changes to the game. 
            <br>It may also act as a source of mod inspiration, since we can just look into the game code
            and see what we can create with it. 
            <br>In fact, if you look widely into the <b>FirstPersonCharacter</b>, you can see there are a lot of other methods we can use to create a mod
            other than <b>SetWalkSpeed</b> and <b>SetRunSpeed</b> &#40;e.g <b>SetSuperJump</b>&#41;.
            <br>That's what we are gonna do in the next lesson.
